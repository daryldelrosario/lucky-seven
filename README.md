## Brief Description
This assessment was created to demonstrate all that we have learnt in the HTML, CSS and JavaScript modules.

This is a simple game with the following rules:
1. As long as there is money, play the game.
2. Each round, the program rolls a virtual pair of dice for the user:
    * if the sum of the 2 dice is equal to 7, player wins $4
    * otherwise, player loses $1
